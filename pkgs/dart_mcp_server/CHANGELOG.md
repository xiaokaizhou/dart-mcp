# 0.1.1 (Dart SDK 3.10.0) - WIP

* Change tools that accept multiple roots to not return immediately on the first
  failure.
* Add failure reason field to analytics events so we can know why tool calls are
  failing.
* Add a flutter_driver command for executing flutter driver commands on a device.
* Allow for multiple package arguments to `pub add` and `pub remove`.
* Require dart_mcp version 0.3.1.
* Add support for the flutter_driver screenshot command.
* Change the widget tree to the full version instead of the summary. The summary
  tends to hide nested text widgets which makes it difficult to find widgets
  based on their text values.
* Add an `--exclude-tool` command line flag to exclude tools by name.
* Add the abillity to limit the output of `analyze_files` to a set of paths.
* Stop reporting non-zero exit codes from command line tools as tool errors.
* Add descriptions for pub tools, add support for `pub deps` and `pub outdated`.
* Fix a bug in hot_reload ([#290](https://github.com/dart-lang/ai/issues/290)).

* Improve error text for failed DTD connections as well as the tool description.
